# blitblort
Want to make a simple HTML5 game?

This library covers the basics of working with canvas, web audio, input and some mathmatical bits to make it easy to create simple games.

The name is derived from [bit blitting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit) and [blort](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blort) is just about making silly sounds.

The library has no dependencies other than an HTML5 compliant web browser, so specifically there's no 'build' step. Unfortuantely that also means there's no packaging support.

It's not even remotely optimized, as it's primary puropose is to make it really easy to extend and modify, while still simplifying the common tasks needed by most games.
